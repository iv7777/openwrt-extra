# AuthShield Configuration File
# Location: /etc/config/authshield
#
# This file configures AuthShield's intrusion prevention system for OpenWrt.
# AuthShield monitors failed login attempts for LuCI/rpcd and optionally Dropbear SSH,
# temporarily banning offending IPs and implementing circuit breaker protection.
#
# After modifying this file, reload the service:
#   /etc/init.d/authshield reload
#
# Or configure via LuCI web interface at: System > AuthShield
